# UNMAINTAINED

# LoopBack AngularJS Seed

`This is very much a work in-progress`

This project is inspired by the AngularJS boilerplate [ngbp](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) and (hopefully) adapted to fit development with a [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/) API backend.

In addition, I wanted to try and implement a detailed build script using [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) in lieu of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

## Components

### Client
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
* [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/)

### Server
* [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/)

### Development
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
* [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/)
